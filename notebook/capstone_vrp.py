### Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)
Simple VRP to generate the closest distance to the workshop.

### Configure Google Maps API key

To run the notebook, you must bring our own Maps Platform API key.  See https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started to get started.

### Build Distance Matrix
The Distance Matrix API builds the cost matrix.  Distance Matrix API returns both the distance and duration for each origin-destination pair.  For the first solution example, we generate the cost matrix using distance.  The cost matrix consists of real-world road distances (based on the Google Maps road network) between each depot and shipment pair and serves as a key input into the VRP solver.  API calls are made with the Python client for Google Maps Services (https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python).

For a second VRP solver run, we generate the cost matrix based on duration.  The goal here is to minimize delivery time.  By comparing these generated routes with the above routes derived from a distance-based cost matrix, itâ€™s evident that the routes differ significantly.  This makes sense considering the goals to minimize either distance or duration can be in competition.
